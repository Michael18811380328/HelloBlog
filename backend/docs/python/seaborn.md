seaborn: statistical data visualization

http://seaborn.pydata.org/

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

For a brief introduction to the ideas behind the library, you can read the [introductory notes](http://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html). Visit the [installation page](http://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html) to see how you can download the package. You can browse the [example gallery](http://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html) to see what you can do with seaborn, and then check out the [tutorial](http://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html) and [API reference](http://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html) to find out how.

To see the code or report a bug, please visit the [github repository](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn). General support issues are most at home on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), where there is a seaborn tag.
