# ðŸ“ˆ Î¼Plot

A small ([< 25 KB min](https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot/tree/master/dist/uPlot.iife.min.js)), [fast](https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot#performance) chart for time series, lines, areas, ohlc & bars *(MIT Licensed)*

------

### Introduction

Î¼Plot is a [fast, memory-efficient](https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot#performance) [Canvas 2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D)-based chart for plotting [time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series), lines, areas, ohlc & bars; from a cold start it can create an interactive chart containing 150,000 data points in 135ms, scaling linearly at [~25,000 pts/ms](https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/bench/uPlot-10M.html). In addition to fast initial render, the zooming and cursor performance is by far the best of any similar charting lib; at < 25 KB, it's likely the smallest and fastest time series plotter that doesn't make use of [context-limited](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=771792) WebGL shaders or WASM, both of which have much higher startup cost and code size.

### 166,650 point bench: https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/bench/uPlot.html

However, if you're looking for true real-time 60fps performance with massive datasets, uPlot [can only get you so far](https://huww98.github.io/TimeChart/docs/performance). WebGL should still be the tool of choice for applications like realtime signal or waveform visualizations: Try [danchitnis/webgl-plot](https://github.com/danchitnis/webgl-plot) or [huww98/TimeChart](https://github.com/huww98/TimeChart).

- [Cursor sync for multiple charts](https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/demos/sync-cursor.html)
- [Focus closest series](https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/demos/focus-cursor.html)
- [Data streaming (live update)](https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/demos/stream-data.html)

- A lean, consistent, and powerful API with hooks & plugins

------

### Non-Features

In order to stay lean, fast and focused the following features will not be added:

- No data parsing, aggregation, summation or statistical processing - just do it in advance. e.g. https://simplestatistics.org/, https://www.papaparse.com/
- No transitions or animations - they're always pure distractions.
- No collision avoidance for axis tick labels, so may require manual tweaking of spacing metrics if label customization signficiantly increases default label widths.
- No [stacked series](https://everydayanalytics.ca/2014/08/stacked-area-graphs-are-not-your-friend.html) or [line smoothing](http://www.vizwiz.com/2011/12/when-you-use-smoothed-line-chart-your.html). See links for how these are each terrible at actually communicating information. While neither will be part of the core, uPlot's API makes it easy to implement both: [stacked-series](https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/demos/stacked-series.html), [line-smoothing](https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/demos/line-smoothing.html).
- No built-in drag scrolling/panning. Maintaining good perf with huge datasets would require a lot of extra code & multiple `<canvas>` elements to avoid continuous redraw and rescaling on each dragged pixel. If you have fewer than tens of thousands of datapoints, you can use uPlot's API to implement smooth zooming or panning. e.g. [zoom-wheel](https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/demos/zoom-wheel.html), [zoom-touch](https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/demos/zoom-touch.html). Pagination of data also works well.

------

### Documentation (WIP)

The docs are a perpetual work in progress, it seems. Start with [/docs/README.md](https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot/tree/master/docs) for a conceptual overview. The full API is further documented via comments in [/dist/uPlot.d.ts](https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot/blob/master/dist/uPlot.d.ts). Additionally, an ever-expanding collection of runnable [/demos](https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/demos/index.html) covers the vast majority of uPlot's API.

```

- `size` includes the lib itself plus any dependencies required to render the benchmark, e.g. Moment, jQuery, etc.
- Flot does not make available any minified assets and all their examples use the uncompressed sources; they also use an uncompressed version of jQuery :/

TODO (all of these use SVG, so performance should be similar to Highcharts):

- Chartist.js
- d3-based
  - C3.js
  - dc.js
  - MetricsGraphics
  - rickshaw
