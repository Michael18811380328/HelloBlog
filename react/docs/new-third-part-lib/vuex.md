#### Vuex

Pinia is now the new default

The official state management library for Vue has changed to
Pinia. Pinia has almost the exact same or enhanced
API as Vuex 5, described in Vuex 5
RFC. You could simply consider Pinia
as Vuex 5 with a different name. Pinia also works with Vue 2.x as well.

Vuex 3 and 4 will still be maintained. However, it's unlikely to add new
functionalities to it. Vuex and Pinia can be installed in the same project. If
you're migrating existing Vuex app to Pinia, it might be a suitable option.
However, if you're planning to start a new project, we highly recommend using
Pinia instead.

​

Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It
serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with
rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. It
also integrates with Vue's official devtools
extension to provide advanced features
such as zero-config time-travel debugging and state snapshot export / import.
