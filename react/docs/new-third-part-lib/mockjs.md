# Mock.js

Mock.js is a simulation data generator to help the front-end to develop and
prototype separate from the back-end progress and reduce some monotony
particularly while writing automated tests.

The official site: <http://mockjs.com>

## Features

  * Generate simulated data according to the data template
  * Provide request/response mocking for ajax requests
  * ~~Generate simulated data according to HTML-based templates~~

This library is loosely inspired by Elijah Manor's post [Mocking

green-bird.html),
