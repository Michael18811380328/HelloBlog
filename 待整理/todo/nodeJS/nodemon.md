Nodemon 会监测代码的变动并热启动服务器，适合于node开发环境，可以取代传统的node。

Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server. Perfect for development. Install it using [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/nodemon).

Just use `nodemon` instead of `node` to run your code, and now your process will automatically restart when your code changes. To install, get [node.js](https://nodejs.org/), then from your terminal run:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

## Features

- Automatic restarting of application.
- Detects default file extension to monitor.
- Default support for node & coffeescript, but easy to run any executable (such as python, make, etc).
- Ignoring specific files or directories.
- Watch specific directories.
- Works with server applications or one time run utilities and REPLs.
- Requirable in node apps.
