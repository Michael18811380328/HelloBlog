## BTI360 teammate Joel Goldberg recently retired after working in the software industry for over four decades. When he left he shared with our team some of the lessons he learned over his career. With his permission, we reshare his wisdom here.

------

Looking back on four decades in the software industry, I’m struck by how much has changed. I started my career with punch cards and I am ending in the era of cloud computing. Despite all this change, many principles that have helped me throughout my career haven’t changed and continue to be relevant. As I step away from the keyboard, I want to share six ideas I’ve learned from my career as a software engineer.

## 1. Beware of the Curse of Knowledge

When you know something it is almost impossible to imagine what it is like *not* to know that thing. This is the curse of knowledge, and it is the root of countless misunderstandings and inefficiencies. Smart people who are comfortable with complexity can be especially prone to it!

If you don’t guard against the curse of knowledge it has the potential to obfuscate all forms of communication, including code. The more specialized your work, the greater the risk that you will communicate in ways that are incomprehensible to the uninitiated. Fight the curse of knowledge. Work to understand your audience. Try to imagine what it would be like to learn what you are communicating for the first time.

## 2. Focus on the Fundamentals

Technology constantly changes, but some fundamental approaches to software development transcend these trends. Here are six fundamentals that will continue to be relevant for a long time.

- **Teamwork** — Great teams build great software. Don’t take teamwork for granted.
- **Trust** — Teams move at the speed of trust. Be the kind of dependable person you would want to work with.
- **Communication** — Communicate honestly and proactively. Avoid the curse of knowledge.
- **Seek Consensus** — Take the time to bring your whole team along. Let discussion and disagreement bring you to the best solution.
- **Automated Testing** — Well-tested code allows your team to move fast with confidence.
- **Clean, understandable, and navigable code and design** — Think of the next engineer that will take over your code as your customer. Build code that your successor won’t have any trouble reading, maintaining, and updating.

## 3. Simplicity

Fighting complexity is a never-ending cause. Solutions should be as simple as possible. Assume the next person to maintain your code won’t be as smart as you. When you can use fewer technologies, do so.

## 4. Seek First to Understand

One of Stephen Covey’s seven habits is, “Seek First To Understand, Then To Be Understood.” This maxim has helped me more than any other advice to become a good listener and teammate. If you want to influence and work effectively with others, you first need to understand them. Actively listen to understand their feelings, ideas, and point of view before you begin trying to make your own thoughts known.

## 5. Beware of Lock-In

There will always be the next hot productivity product that will promise to revolutionize how software is built. Computer Assisted Software Engineering (CASE) tools, COTS, Enterprise Resource Planning products like Peoplesoft and SAP and, yes, even Ruby. They claim amazing reductions in cost and time if you buy into their holistic development philosophy. What is not always as obvious is the significant up-front costs or the constraints you may be committing yourself to. Lock-in used to primarily happen with vendors, but now it can happen with frameworks too. Either way, lock-in means significant cost to change. Choose wisely. New is not always better!

## 6. Be Honest and Acknowledge When You Don’t Fit the Role

At some point in your career you may find yourself in a role that isn’t a good fit. A bad fit isn’t a character flaw, but it’s a problem you shouldn’t ignore. There may be more than one solution to such a dilemma: you can evolve or the role can evolve. The key is to have the self-knowledge to recognize what is happening and get yourself out of an unhealthy spot. Being unhappy is in no-one’s best interests, and BTI360 recognizes this.

When I was at GM, you were a failure if your next move was not *up*—managing more people or taking on bigger, more complex projects. For many, this made for a miserable career path (see the [Peter Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle)). At EDS, the culture wasn’t like this. People moved in and out of management roles. There was no stigma associated with moving from roles with greater scope, like strategic planner, to roles with more narrow scope, like PM or project-level developer. I was one of the people who took advantage of this flexibility, moving from a role at the top of the technical pyramid back to being a project-level developer. I never looked back.

## Final Thoughts

Even before I joined BTI360 I knew enough about the culture to know that it was a place that valued the kinds of principles I’ve described above. I hope each of you will take ownership of maintaining a strong engineering culture that will continue to make BTI360 a great place to build software.



BTI360的队友乔尔·戈德堡（Joel Goldberg）在软件行业工作了超过四十年后，最近退休。当他离开时，他与我们的团队分享了他在职业生涯中学到的一些经验教训。在他的允许下，我们在这里分享他的智慧。
回顾软件行业的四十年，我为之震惊。我从打孔卡开始了我的职业生涯，并在云计算时代结束了。尽管发生了所有这些变化，但在我的整个职业生涯中对我有帮助的许多原则并没有改变，并且仍然具有现实意义。当我离开键盘时，我想分享我从软件工程师的职业生涯中学到的六个想法。

### 1.当心知识的诅咒

当您知道某件事时，几乎无法想象不知道那件事是什么感觉。这是知识的诅咒，也是无数误解和效率低下的根源。精于复杂性的聪明人尤其容易受此困扰！

如果您不防备知识的诅咒，则有可能混淆所有形式的交流，包括代码。您的工作越专业，以新手无法理解的方式进行交流的风险就越大。对抗知识的诅咒。努力了解您的听众。尝试想象一下第一次学习交流的感觉。

### 2.专注于基本原理

技术不断变化，但是一些软件开发的基本方法超越了这些趋势。这是六个基本原理，在很长一段时间内仍将持续存在。

团队合作-优秀的团队构建出色的软件。不要将团队合作视为理所当然。
信任-团队以信任的速度前进。成为您想要与之合作的可靠人。
沟通-诚实主动地沟通。避免知识的诅咒。
寻求共识-花些时间使您的整个团队团结起来。让讨论和分歧为您带来最佳解决方案。
自动化测试-经过良好测试的代码使您的团队充满信心地快速前进。
干净，可理解且可导航的代码和设计-考虑下一位工程师将以您的客户身份接管您的代码。构建代码，使您的后继者在阅读，维护和更新时不会遇到任何麻烦。

### 3.简单性

对抗复杂性是永无止境的。解决方案应尽可能简单。假设下一个维护您代码的人不会像您那么聪明。当您可以使用更少的技术时，请这样做。

“设计师知道他已经实现了完美，不是没有什么可添加的，而是什么都没有带走的。”

安托万·德·圣艾修伯里

### 4.首先寻求了解

斯蒂芬·科维（Stephen Covey）的七个习惯之一是：“先了解后了解。”这一格言比起其他任何建议，对我的帮助更重要，成为了一个很好的倾听者和队友。如果您想影响他人并与他人有效地合作，则首先需要了解他们。在开始尝试表达自己的想法之前，请积极倾听以了解他们的感受，想法和观点。

### 5.当心锁定

始终会有下一个热门生产力产品，该产品将有望彻底改变软件的构建方式。计算机辅助软件工程（CASE）工具，COTS，企业资源计划产品（例如Peoplesoft和SAP），甚至是Ruby。如果您接受他们的整体发展理念，他们就会声称在成本和时间上都有惊人的减少。并不总是那么明显的是巨大的前期成本或您可能要承担的约束。锁定过去主要发生在供应商中，但现在也可以发生在框架中。无论哪种方式，锁定都意味着巨大的变更成本。做出明智的选择。新的并不总是更好！

### 6.当你不适合这个角色时要诚实和承认

在职业生涯的某个时刻，您可能会发现自己的职位不合适。不合适不是角色缺陷，但这是您不容忽视的问题。解决这一难题的方法可能不止一种：您可以演变，也可以角色扮演。关键是要具有自我认识的能力，以识别正在发生的事情并使自己远离不健康的地方。不开心不符合任何人的最大利益，BTI360意识到这一点。

当我在通用汽车公司任职时，如果下一步行动不对，您就会失败，那就是管理更多的人或进行更大，更复杂的项目。对于许多人来说，这是一条痛苦的职业道路（请参阅彼得原理）。在EDS，文化不是这样的。人们迁入和移出管理职位。从具有更大范围的角色（如战略计划者）转到具有更窄范围的角色（如PM或项目级开发人员）没有污名化。我是利用这种灵活性的人之一，从技术金字塔顶端的角色转变为项目级开发人员。我从不回头。
