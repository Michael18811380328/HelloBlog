## Biography 生平

Charlotte Bront (夏洛特·勃朗特 1816-1855).—Novelist（小说家）, daughter of the Rev. Patrick B., a clergyman（牧师） of Irish descent（爱尔兰血统） and of eccentric habits（古怪的习惯） who embittered（折磨） the lives of his children by his peculiar（独特的） theories（理论） of education.

Brought up（长大） in a small parsonage（牧师住所） close to the graveyard（墓地） of a bleak（荒凉的）, windswept（暴露在风中的） village on the Yorkshire moors（约克夏摩斯）, and left motherless（无母的） in early childhood, she was “the motherly（母亲一样的） friend and guardian（监护人） of her younger sisters,” of whom two（其中有两个人）, Emily and Anne, shared, but in a less degree, her talents（分享了她们的才能）.

After various（各种） efforts as schoolmistresses（女教师） and governesses（女家庭教师）, the sisters took to literature（迷上了文学） and published a vol. of poems（一卷诗集） under the names of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell（柯勒·埃利斯和阿克顿·贝尔）, which, however, fell flat. （作为学校的女教师和家庭教师，姐妹俩做了各种努力后，开始接触文学，并以柯勒·埃利斯和阿克顿·贝尔的名字出版了一卷诗集，但没有成功）

Charlotte then wrote her first novel, The Professor, which did not appear（出版发表） until after her death, and began Jane Eyre, which, appearing in 1847, took the public by storm（引起了公众的强烈反响）. It was followed by Shirley（雪莉） in 1849, and Villette（维莱特） in 1852. In 1854 she was married to her father’s curate（助理牧师）, the Rev. A. Nicholls, but after a short though happy married life she died in 1855.

Anne B. (1820-1849) was the authoress（女作者） of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall and Agnes Grey （《怀尔德菲尔庄园的房客》和《艾格尼丝·格雷》）(1848). She had not the intellectual force（智力） of her sisters. The novels of Charlotte especially created a strong impression from the first, and the published of Jane Eyre gave rise to much curiosity and speculation（推测） as to its authorship（原创作者）. Their strength and originality have retained for them a high place in English fiction（小说） which is likely to（可能） prove（证实） permanent（永久的）. There is a biography of Charlotte by Mrs. Gaskell (q.v.).

Emily Bront (1818-1848).—Novelist and poet. Sister to Charlotte and Anne. Wrote a story of extraordinary reality（非凡的显示） and imagination in Wuthering Heights（呼啸山庄）; in whose pages the Yorkshire（约克郡） moors（荒野） are given a wild and tragic（悲惨的） personal reality. The same emotional（情感的） force marks the best of her poems, though written with an apparently（明显的） heedless（不留心的） pen for her own relief（减轻自己的痛苦）.
